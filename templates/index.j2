                            Company information can be found on this page. With the recent advances in technology, we're always
                            on the lookout to partner with more pharmaceutical companies. We reserve the right to discontinue
                            partnerships with any company who does not have our patients' best interests in mind.

                        <p>
                            Drug information can be found on this page. Drugs can be added to our system as they are approved. 
                            If recent studies determine that the adverse effects of a drug outweight the benefits, we can also
                            delete it from our system.

                            current patients, or delete patients from the system.

                            Information about drugs and their manufacturing companies can be found on this page. Each drug is 
                            associated with at least one company. Companies are not required to have a drug (could still be in
                            research & development, or clinical trials), but can be associated with many drugs.

                            permitted to edit a prescription. You will primarily add new prescriptions, or delete old ones.
